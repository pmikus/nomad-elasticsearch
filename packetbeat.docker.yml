###################### Packetbeat Configuration Example #######################

# This file is a full configuration example documenting all non-deprecated
# options in comments. For a shorter configuration example, that contains only
# the most common options, please see packetbeat.yml in the same directory.
#
# You can find the full configuration reference here:
# https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/packetbeat/index.html

#============================== Network device ================================

# Select the network interface to sniff the data. You can use the "any"
# keyword to sniff on all connected interfaces.
packetbeat.interfaces.device: any

# Packetbeat supports three sniffer types:
# * pcap, which uses the libpcap library and works on most platforms, but it's
# not the fastest option.
# * af_packet, which uses memory-mapped sniffing. This option is faster than
# libpcap and doesn't require a kernel module, but it's Linux-specific.
#packetbeat.interfaces.type: pcap

# The maximum size of the packets to capture. The default is 65535, which is
# large enough for almost all networks and interface types. If you sniff on a
# physical network interface, the optimal setting is the MTU size. On virtual
# interfaces, however, it's safer to accept the default value.
#packetbeat.interfaces.snaplen: 65535

# The maximum size of the shared memory buffer to use between the kernel and
# user space. A bigger buffer usually results in lower CPU usage, but consumes
# more memory. This setting is only available for the af_packet sniffer type.
# The default is 30 MB.
#packetbeat.interfaces.buffer_size_mb: 30

# Packetbeat automatically generates a BPF for capturing only the traffic on
# ports where it expects to find known protocols. Use this settings to tell
# Packetbeat to generate a BPF filter that accepts VLAN tags.
#packetbeat.interfaces.with_vlans: true

# Use this setting to override the automatically generated BPF filter.
#packetbeat.interfaces.bpf_filter:

# With `auto_promisc_mode` Packetbeat puts interface in promiscuous mode automatically on startup.
# This option does not work with `any` interface device.
# The default option is false and requires manual set-up of promiscuous mode.
# Warning: under some circumstances (e.g beat crash) promiscuous mode
# can stay enabled even after beat is shut down.
#packetbeat.interfaces.auto_promisc_mode: true

#================================== Flows =====================================

packetbeat.flows:
  # Enable Network flows. Default: true
  #enabled: true

  # (authority resource records) is added to messages.
  # Default: false
  include_authorities: true
  # include_additionals controls whether or not the dns.additionals field
  # (additional resource records) is added to messages.
  # Default: false
  include_additionals: true

  # send_request and send_response control whether or not the stringified DNS
  # request and response message are added to the result.
  # Nearly all data about the request/response is available in the dns.*
  # fields, but this can be useful if you need visibility specifically
  # into the request or the response.
  # Default: false
  # send_request:  true
  # send_response: true

  # Set to true to publish fields with null values in events.
  #keep_null: false

  # Transaction timeout. Expired transactions will no longer be correlated to
  # incoming responses, but sent to Elasticsearch immediately.
  #transaction_timeout: 10s

  # Enable HTTP monitoring. Default: true
  #enabled: true

  # Configure the ports where to listen for HTTP traffic. You can disable
  # the HTTP protocol by commenting out the list of ports.
  ports: [80, 8080, 8000, 5000, 8002]

  # Uncomment the following to hide certain parameters in URL or forms attached
  # to HTTP requests. The names of the parameters are case insensitive.
  # The value of the parameters will be replaced with the 'xxxxx' string.
  # This is generally useful for avoiding storing user passwords or other
  # sensitive information.
  # Only query parameters and top level form parameters are replaced.

  # the header field present, but will redact it's value to show the headers
  # presence.
  #redact_headers: []

  # The list of content types for which Packetbeat includes the full HTTP
  # payload. If the request's or response's Content-Type matches any on this
  # list, the full body will be included under the request or response field.

  # Whether the body of a request must be decoded when a content-encoding
  # or transfer-encoding has been applied.
  #decode_body: true

  # If the Cookie or Set-Cookie headers are sent, this option controls whether
  # they are split into individual values.
  #split_cookie: false

  # The header field to extract the real IP from. This setting is useful when
  # you want to capture traffic behind a reverse proxy, but you want to get the
  # geo-location information.
  #real_ip_header:

  # If this option is enabled, the raw message of the request (`request` field)
  # is sent to Elasticsearch. The default is false.
  #send_request: false

  # If this option is enabled, the raw message of the response (`response`
  # field) is sent to Elasticsearch. The default is false.
  #send_response: false

  # Set to true to publish fields with null values in events.
  #keep_null: false

  # Transaction timeout. Expired transactions will no longer be correlated to
  # incoming responses, but sent to Elasticsearch immediately.
  #transaction_timeout: 10s

  # Maximum message size. If an HTTP message is larger than this, it will
  # be trimmed to this size. Default is 10 MB.
  #max_message_size: 10485760

- type: tls
  # Enable TLS monitoring. Default: true
  #enabled: true

  # Configure the ports where to listen for TLS traffic. You can disable
  # the TLS protocol by commenting out the list of ports.
  ports:
    - 443   # HTTPS
    - 8443
    - 9243  # Elasticsearch

  # List of hash algorithms to use to calculate certificates' fingerprints.
  # Valid values are `sha1`, `sha256` and `md5`.
  #fingerprints: [sha1]

  # If this option is enabled, the client and server certificates and
  # certificate chains are sent to Elasticsearch. The default is true.
  #send_certificates: true

  # If this option is enabled, the raw certificates will be stored
  # in PEM format under the `raw` key. The default is false.
  #include_raw_certificates: false

  # Set to true to publish fields with null values in events.
  #keep_null: false

#=========================== Monitored processes ==============================

# Packetbeat can enrich events with information about the process associated
# the socket that sent or received the packet if Packetbeat is monitoring
# traffic from the host machine. By default process enrichment is disabled.
# This feature works on Linux and Windows.
packetbeat.procs.enabled: false

# If you want to ignore transactions created by the server on which the shipper
# is installed you can enable this option. This option is useful to remove
# duplicates if shippers are installed on multiple servers. Default value is
# false.
packetbeat.ignore_outgoing: false

#================================ General ======================================

# The name of the shipper that publishes the network data. It can be used to group
# all the transactions sent by a single shipper in the web interface.
# If this options is not defined, the hostname is used.
#name:

# The tags of the shipper are included in their own field with each
# transaction published. Tags make it easy to group servers by different
# logical properties.
#tags: ["service-X", "web-tier"]

# Optional fields that you can specify to add additional information to the
# output. Fields can be scalar values, arrays, dictionaries, or any nested
# combination of these.
#fields:
#  env: staging

# If this option is set to true, the custom fields are stored as top-level
# fields in the output document instead of being grouped under a fields
# sub-dictionary. Default is false.
#fields_under_root: false

# Internal queue configuration for buffering events to be published.
#queue:
  # Queue type by name (default 'mem')
  # The memory queue will present all available events (up to the outputs
  # bulk_max_size) to the output, the moment the output is ready to server
  # another batch of events.
  #mem:
    # Max number of events the queue can buffer.
    #events: 4096

    # Hints the minimum number of events stored in the queue,

    # A value of 0 ensures events are immediately available
    # to be sent to the outputs.
    #flush.min_events: 2048

    # Maximum duration after which events are available to the outputs,
    # if the number of events stored in the queue is < `flush.min_events`.
    #flush.timeout: 1s

  # The spool queue will store events in a local spool file, before
  # forwarding the events to the outputs.
  #
  # Beta: spooling to disk is currently a beta feature. Use with care.
  #
  # The spool file is a circular buffer, which blocks once the file/buffer is full.
  # Events are put into a write buffer and flushed once the write buffer
  # is full or the flush_timeout is triggered.
  # Once ACKed by the output, events are removed immediately from the queue,
  # making space for new events to be persisted.
  #spool:
    # The file namespace configures the file path and the file creation settings.
    # Once the file exists, the `size`, `page_size` and `prealloc` settings
    # will have no more effect.
    #file:
      # Location of spool file. The default value is ${path.data}/spool.dat.
      #path: "${path.data}/spool.dat"

      # Configure file permissions if file is created. The default value is 0600.
      #permissions: 0600

      # File size hint. The spool blocks, once this limit is reached. The default value is 100 MiB.
      #size: 100MiB

      # The files page size. A file is split into multiple pages of the same size. The default value is 4KiB.
      #page_size: 4KiB

      # If prealloc is set, the required space for the file is reserved using
      # truncate. The default value is true.
      #prealloc: true

    # Spool writer settings
    # Events are serialized into a write buffer. The write buffer is flushed if:
    # - The buffer limit has been reached.
    # - The configured limit of buffered events is reached.
    # - The flush timeout is triggered.
    #write:
      # Sets the write buffer size.
      #buffer_size: 1MiB

      # Maximum duration after which events are flushed if the write buffer
      # is not full yet. The default value is 1s.
      #flush.timeout: 1s

      # Number of maximum buffered events. The write buffer is flushed once the
      # limit is reached.
      #flush.events: 16384

      # Configure the on-disk event encoding. The encoding can be changed
      # between restarts.
      # Valid encodings are: json, ubjson, and cbor.
      #codec: cbor
    #read:
      # Reader flush timeout, waiting for more events to become available, so
      # to fill a complete batch as required by the outputs.
      # If flush_timeout is 0, all available events are forwarded to the
      # outputs immediately.
      # The default value is 0s.
      #flush.timeout: 0s

# Sets the maximum number of CPUs that can be executing simultaneously. The
# default is the number of logical CPUs available in the system.
#max_procs:

#================================ Processors ===================================

# Processors are used to reduce the number of fields in the exported event or to
# enhance the event with external metadata. This section defines a list of
# processors that are applied one by one and the first one receives the initial
# event:
#
#   event -> filter1 -> event1 -> filter2 ->event2 ...
#
# The supported processors are drop_fields, drop_event, include_fields,
# decode_json_fields, and add_cloud_metadata.
#
# For example, you can use the following processors to keep the fields that
# contain CPU load percentages, but remove the fields that contain CPU ticks
# values:
#
#processors:
#  - include_fields:
#      fields: ["cpu"]
#  - drop_fields:
#      fields: ["cpu.user", "cpu.system"]
#
# The following example drops the events that have the HTTP response code 200:
#
#processors:
#  - drop_event:
#      when:
#        equals:
#          http.code: 200
#
# The following example renames the field a to b:
#
#processors:
#  - rename:
#      fields:
#        - from: "a"
#          to: "b"
#
# The following example tokenizes the string into fields:
#
#processors:
#  - dissect:
#      tokenizer: "%{key1} - %{key2}"
#      field: "message"
#      target_prefix: "dissect"
#
# The following example enriches each event with metadata from the cloud
# provider about the host machine. It works on EC2, GCE, DigitalOcean,
# Tencent Cloud, and Alibaba Cloud.
#
#processors:
#  - add_cloud_metadata: ~
#
# The following example enriches each event with the machine's local time zone
# offset from UTC.
#
#processors:
#  - add_locale:
#      format: offset
#
# The following example enriches each event with docker metadata, it matches
# given fields to an existing container id and adds info from that container:
#
#processors:
#  - add_docker_metadata:
#      host: "unix:///var/run/docker.sock"
#      match_fields: ["system.process.cgroup.id"]
#      match_pids: ["process.pid", "process.ppid"]
#      match_source: true
#      match_source_index: 4
#      match_short_id: false
#      cleanup_timeout: 60
#      labels.dedot: false
#      # To connect to Docker over TLS you must specify a client and CA certificate.
#      #ssl:
#      #  certificate_authority: "/etc/pki/root/ca.pem"
#      #  certificate:           "/etc/pki/client/cert.pem"
#      #  key:                   "/etc/pki/client/cert.key"
#
# The following example enriches each event with docker metadata, it matches
# container id from log path available in `source` field (by default it expects
# it to be /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log).
#
#processors:
#  - add_docker_metadata: ~
#
# The following example enriches each event with host metadata.
#
#processors:
#  - add_host_metadata: ~
#
# The following example enriches each event with process metadata using
# process IDs included in the event.
#
#processors:
#  - add_process_metadata:
#      match_pids: ["system.process.ppid"]
#      target: system.process.parent
#
# The following example decodes fields containing JSON strings
# and replaces the strings with valid JSON objects.
#
#processors:
#  - decode_json_fields:
#      fields: ["field1", "field2", ...]
#      process_array: false
#      max_depth: 1
#      target: ""
#      overwrite_keys: false
#
#processors:
#  - decompress_gzip_field:
#      from: "field1"
#      to: "field2"
#      ignore_missing: false
#      fail_on_error: true
#
# The following example copies the value of message to message_copied
#
#processors:
#  - copy_fields:
#      fields:
#        - from: message
#          to: message_copied
#      fail_on_error: true
#      ignore_missing: false
#
# The following example truncates the value of message to 1024 bytes
#
#processors:
#  - truncate_fields:
#      fields:
#        - message
#      max_bytes: 1024
#      fail_on_error: false
#      ignore_missing: true
#
# The following example preserves the raw message under event.original
#
#processors:
#  - copy_fields:
#      fields:
#        - from: message
#          to: event.original
#      fail_on_error: false
#      ignore_missing: true
#  - truncate_fields:

#============================== Setup ILM =====================================

# Configure index lifecycle management (ILM). These settings create a write
# alias and add additional settings to the index template. When ILM is enabled,
# output.elasticsearch.index is ignored, and the write alias is used to set the
# index name.

# Enable ILM support. Valid values are true, false, and auto. When set to auto
# (the default), the Beat uses index lifecycle management when it connects to a
# cluster that supports ILM; otherwise, it creates daily indices.
